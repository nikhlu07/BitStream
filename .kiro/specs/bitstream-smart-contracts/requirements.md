# BitStream Smart Contracts Requirements

## Introduction

BitStream requires smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to handle content monetization, payments, and access control. The system needs to support creators uploading content, viewers paying for access, and automatic revenue distribution.

## Glossary

- **BitStream System**: The decentralized content platform built on Stacks blockchain
- **Creator**: A user who uploads and monetizes content on the platform
- **Viewer**: A user who pays to access premium content
- **Content NFT**: A non-fungible token representing ownership and access rights to content
- **Payment Contract**: Smart contract handling STX payments and revenue distribution
- **Access Control Contract**: Smart contract managing content access permissions
- **Revenue Share**: Percentage of payment distributed to platform vs creator

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Content Registration and Ownership

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to register my content on-chain so that I can prove ownership and control access rights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a creator uploads content, THE BitStream System SHALL create a unique Content NFT with metadata
2. THE BitStream System SHALL store content metadata including title, description, price, and IPFS hash
3. THE BitStream System SHALL assign the creator as the initial owner of the Content NFT
4. THE BitStream System SHALL emit an event when new content is registered
5. THE BitStream System SHALL prevent duplicate content registration using content hash verification

### Requirement 2: Payment Processing

**User Story:** As a viewer, I want to pay for content access using STX tokens so that I can unlock premium content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a viewer initiates payment, THE Payment Contract SHALL verify the payment amount matches content price
2. THE Payment Contract SHALL transfer STX tokens from viewer to the contract escrow
3. THE Payment Contract SHALL distribute revenue according to predefined percentages (90% creator, 10% platform)
4. THE Payment Contract SHALL grant access permissions to the paying viewer
5. THE Payment Contract SHALL emit payment events for tracking and analytics

### Requirement 3: Access Control Management

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to control who can access my content so that only paying viewers can consume it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Access Control Contract SHALL maintain a mapping of viewer addresses to content access rights
2. WHEN payment is confirmed, THE Access Control Contract SHALL grant access to the paying viewer
3. THE Access Control Contract SHALL allow creators to revoke access in case of violations
4. THE Access Control Contract SHALL provide read-only functions to verify access permissions
5. THE Access Control Contract SHALL support time-based access expiration if configured

### Requirement 4: Revenue Distribution

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to receive my share of payments automatically so that I don't need manual intervention for each transaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Payment Contract SHALL automatically split payments upon receipt (90% creator, 10% platform)
2. THE Payment Contract SHALL transfer creator share directly to creator's wallet
3. THE Payment Contract SHALL accumulate platform fees in a designated treasury wallet
4. THE Payment Contract SHALL emit events for all revenue distribution transactions
5. THE Payment Contract SHALL handle edge cases like failed transfers gracefully

### Requirement 5: Content Metadata Management

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to update my content information so that I can modify pricing and descriptions after publication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE BitStream System SHALL allow only content owners to update metadata
2. THE BitStream System SHALL preserve content hash and ownership during updates
3. THE BitStream System SHALL emit events when content metadata is modified
4. THE BitStream System SHALL maintain version history of content updates
5. THE BitStream System SHALL prevent price changes that affect existing access rights

### Requirement 6: Platform Administration

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage platform settings so that I can update fees and handle disputes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE BitStream System SHALL allow designated admin addresses to update platform fee percentages
2. THE BitStream System SHALL provide emergency pause functionality for security incidents
3. THE BitStream System SHALL allow admin to resolve disputes by transferring content ownership
4. THE BitStream System SHALL emit admin action events for transparency
5. THE BitStream System SHALL implement multi-signature requirements for critical admin functions

### Requirement 7: Integration with Frontend

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear contract interfaces so that I can integrate the smart contracts with the React frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE BitStream System SHALL provide read-only functions for querying content information
2. THE BitStream System SHALL provide functions for checking user access permissions
3. THE BitStream System SHALL emit standardized events that the frontend can monitor
4. THE BitStream System SHALL return structured data that matches frontend data models
5. THE BitStream System SHALL provide batch query functions for efficient data retrieval
